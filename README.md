### **Project Description**

This project is a **Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Tool** designed to perform the following tasks:  

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches historical stock data using the Alpha Vantage API.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes stock prices and trading volumes.  
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates correlations, daily volatility, stationarity tests, and seasonal decomposition.  
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to forecast stock prices based on historical trends.  
5. **Visualization**: Provides detailed plots for true vs. predicted stock prices, aiding in model evaluation.

The project is implemented in Python, leveraging powerful libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Tool

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive framework for stock market analysis and price prediction. It fetches historical stock data, performs statistical and exploratory analyses, and builds an LSTM-based predictive model to forecast future stock prices.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Retrieves stock data using the Alpha Vantage API.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
  - Plot historical stock prices.
  - Analyze trading volumes.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Compute correlations between stock metrics.
  - Assess daily volatility.
  - Perform stationarity tests and seasonal decomposition.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Prepares stock data for LSTM neural networks.
  - Builds and trains an LSTM model for stock price prediction.
- **Visualization**:
  - Compare true vs. predicted prices.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or above
- Alpha Vantage API key (replace `API_KEY` in the code)

### Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt`:
```plaintext
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
tensorflow
scikit-learn
statsmodels
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/stock-analysis-prediction.git
   cd stock-analysis-prediction
   ```

2. Replace the placeholder `API_KEY` in `data_collection.py` with your Alpha Vantage API key.

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. View the results:
   - Plots for EDA and statistical analyses.
   - Predicted vs. true stock prices.
